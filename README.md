# SaaS-Customer-Life-Value-Prediction

This is an Excel challenge for a Data Analyst position at a SaaS company. The company name has been removed for privacy protection.

```
You are given 2 tables (as tabs in this workbook):
- Users is a table has one row per user who creates an account.
- Premium_Log has one row per premium purchase. Users (optionally) buy a $39.99 subscription some time after account creation with a duration of 1 year, after which it may be renewed.

1) Recommend a methodology and actually calculate the Lifetime Value (LTV) of a user. LTV is the expected (average) lifetime gross profits the company will realize from a given user who creates an account -- whether or not the user buys premium.
Hint: We have not observed the full lifetime of all users included here.
2) Do all users behave the same way? How should that impact the way company thinks about LTV?
3) Why is LTV an important metric for the business? How can we use it as a strategic metric for the Business?
```
The purpose of sharing this assignment is to illustrate how to estimate customers' lifetime value (LTV) and evaluate the quality of this metric by analyzing customer behaviors among different segments.

As discussed in my solution, LTV is a very useful business metric, but it is also a very tricky measurement because it can be misleading when inappropriately estimated.


Here is a Quora answer that I found very helpful explaining the concept of LTV and how to estimate LTV for SaaS customers:
